\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
In this moment of accomplishment in these troublesome times, I would like to thank my supervisor Prof. Dr. Thomas Specht for convincing me of the value of my work and its results and thereby encouraging me to finish this thesis at a point of resignation. Furthermore, his extensive and constructive feedback was of immense value.\par
I took great inspiration from the conversations I had with my supervisor Pierre-Alain Mouy. His experience, motivating character and solution-oriented mindset positively influenced the design concept phases in particular. I would like to thank him for introducing me to the idea of working on this thesis and inviting me to work on it at - and as part of - \emph{NVISO}.\par
This thesis would lack important input from professionals if it was not for the openness of the volunteers at \emph{NVISO} which took their time and participated in interviews. I would like to express my gratitude to Patrick Eisenschmidt, Oliver Nettinger, Cédric Bassem, Théo Rigas, Pierre-Alain Mouy, and Jonah Bellemans for the time, effort and interest they put into these interviews.\par
Further, I want to thank Patrick Eisenschmidt and Adrian Gast for proof-reading this thesis and providing valuable feedback.\par
Finally, I cannot begin to express my thanks to my wife Marie-Darline Thomas for her sincere, ongoing and unfailing love and support. I deeply appreciate her belief in me, her encouragement and her being there when I need her.
