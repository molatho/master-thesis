\section{Design Patterns}
The following sub-sections introduce a set of design patterns that are of relevance to this work.

\subsection{Pipeline/Pipes and Filters Pattern}
In a paper from 1996, Alencar et al. describe the pipes and filters pattern as a mechanism to process streams of data \cite{alencar_cowan_lucena_1996}. They state that the pattern features \enquote{pipes} and \enquote{filters} components: pipes relay data streams between filters while the filters process the data streams' contents. Figure \ref{fig:dp-pipes-filters} shows an exemplaric sequence of $n$ pipes and filters relaying and processing an object $O$ by implementing pipes as method calls. Alencar et al. state that the pattern's \enquote{objective is to obtain highly reusable, interchangeable and maintainable applications}.

    \captionof{figure}{An abstract sequence diagram of the pipes and filters design pattern. The relaying mechanism used by pipes in this diagram is realized through method calls.}
    \label{fig:dp-pipes-filters}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Abstract Factory/Kit Pattern}
Gamma et al. describe the intent of the abstract factory pattern as follows: "provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes" \cite{Gamma1998}. They propose the following components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \enquote{AbstractProduct}: interface for products.
    \item \enquote{AbstractFactory}: interface for creating objects that implement \enquote{AbstractProduct}.
    \item \enquote{ConcreteProduct}: classes that implement \enquote{AbstractProduct}.
    \item \enquote{ConcreteFactory}: classes that implements \enquote{AbstractFactory} and create \enquote{ConcreteProducts}.
    \item \enquote{Client}: class that only uses the interfaces of \enquote{AbstractProducts} and \enquote{AbstractFactories}.
\end{itemize}
They conclude that there are multiple consequences to using the pattern, one being that it \enquote{isolates concrete classes}, meaning that there is a clear isolation from the Client and the ConcreteFactories.

\subsection{Publish-Subscribe/Observer Pattern}
%CITE: 1997 - Book - Design Patterns
In their book \enquote{Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object-oriented Software}, Gamma et al. state that the observer pattern aims to "define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically" \cite{Gamma1998}. To achieve this, they propose the following components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \enquote{Observer}: interface for observing objects. It defines a single \emph{Update} method.
    \item \enquote{Subject}: interface for observable objects that can (un-)register \enquote{Observers} by defining \emph{Attach} and \emph{Detach} methods. It can notify its registered \enquote{Observers} by use of its \emph{Notify} method which calls all of its \enquote{Observers'} \emph{Update} methods.
\end{itemize}
Gamma et al. point out a number of benefits using this pattern. The \enquote{support for broadcast communication} is a benefit of particular relevance for this thesis as it puts a focus on the simplification of the process of sending notification to multiple, interested objects. For this reason, this pattern is used in communication protocols such as \ac{MQTT} (further elaborated on in section \ref{sec:iot-common-protocols}).


\section{Computer Communication: The OSI-Model}
\label{sec:computer-networks}
The \ac{OSI}-Model was initially proposed in the \ac{ISO}/\ac{IEC} standard \enquote{\ac{ISO} 7498 - Information processing systems — Open Systems Interconnection — Basic Reference Model} in 1984 and revised in 1994 by the \ac{ISO}/\ac{IEC} standard 7498-1 \cite{ISOIEC74981}. It aims to formalize a unified approach to communication between diverse peer systems by defining the \emph{network layers} shown in figure \ref{fig:osi-model}. These layers are read from bottom to top, increasing in complexity and abstraction:
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=14cm]{img/ch03/osi-model.png}
    \captionof{figure}{\enquote{Seven layer reference model and peer protocols} \cite{ISOIEC74981} as proposed in \ac{ISO}/\ac{IEC} 7498.}
    \label{fig:osi-model}
\end{figure}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Physical: Bitwise transmission of data (e.g. via copper cable or fibre glass).
    \item Data Link: Aggregation of bitwise data into data frames (e.g. via Ethernet packets sent via \ac{WLAN}) and transmission of those frames to a communication destination.
    \item Network: Encapsulates data frames into packets (e.g. \ac{IP} packets) and routes and relays those packets across network nodes that are identified by addresses (i.e. \ac{IP} addresses).
    \item Transport: Splits packets of arbitrary lengths into transmissible packets and ensures their successful transmission (when using \ac{TCP}). Also, it servers as an abstraction layer for applications that operate on higher layers.
    \item Session: Nowadays part of the \ac{TCP} protocol, the session layer handles establishing and terminating of connections between applications.
    \item Presentation: Encoding information in a format accepted by all communication peers involved (i.e. \ac{XML} and \ac{JSON}).
    \item Application: High-level application functionality that makes use of the lower layers to communicate with peers (e.g. \ac{HTTP}).
\end{enumerate}
This concept of a stack of network layers results in a series of encapsulated messages. For example, a large \ac{HTTP} response containing a binary file can be represented as follows over the various layers:
\begin{etaremune}
    \item Application: The \ac{HTTP} response itself.
    \item Presentation: The text-based \ac{HTTP} headers and the binary content encoded as raw bytes.
    \item \textit{(Session: Part of the \ac{TCP} protocol.)}
    \item Transport: Multiple \ac{TCP} packets with a binary payload and header information about the source and destination ports.
    \item Network: Multiple \ac{IP} packets with a binary payload and header information about the source and destination addresses.
    \item Data Link: Multiple Ethernet frames with a binary payload and header information about the source and destination peer's \ac{MAC} addresses.
    \item \textit{(Physical: Stream of individual bits that make up the Ethernet frames.)}
\end{etaremune}


\section{Internet of Things}
\label{sec:internet-of-things}
\subsection{Fields of Use}
In their paper, Perera et al. categorized \ac{IoT} applications into several classes \cite{IOTSurvey}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[A]{Smart Wearable: smart products that can be worn on different body parts or clothing.}
    \item[B]{Smart Home: connected applications installed and/or used in home environments.}
    \item[C]{Smart City: connected applications for large-scale use in cities that support logistic challenges such as traffic control and resource management.}
    \item[D]{Smart Environment: applications that provide monitoring capabilities for environmental metrics such as air quality and water quality.}
    \item[E]{Smart Enterprise: applications used in commercial and industrial environments to address challenging tasks such as logistics, transportation and energy management.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Common Protocols}
\label{sec:iot-common-protocols}
Building up on pre-existing network infrastructure and in order to meet requirements specific to individual fields of use and use-case scenarios, the landscape of \ac{IoT} attends with a great variety of \emph{communication protocols} (further used to refer to both transport and application protocols). This section will provide a brief overview of the working principles, use cases and history of some protocols commonly used in \ac{IoT} and \ac{IIoT} applications today.
\subsubsection{Hypertext Transfer Protocol (\ac{HTTP})}
Initially conceived by Berners-Lee et al. at the \ac{CERN} in 1991, the \ac{HTTP} protocol is an application layer protocol that defines \emph{requests} to resources made by clients and \emph{responses} to said requests replied by servers \cite{http1991}. According to RFC1945, \ac{HTTP} requests consist of \cite{rfc1945}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A request line including the \ac{HTTP} verb (e.g. $GET$ or $POST$), the requested resource and the \ac{HTTP} version used (e.g. $HTTP/1.0$). The verb can be used to indicates what kind action is requested (i.e. a $GET$ request should retrieve contents while a $POST$ request could be used to create new content). The request line is terminated by a set of \ac{CR} \ac{LF} characters.
    \item A set of request header fields delimited by a set of \ac{CR} \ac{LF} characters where headers are encoded in the format $Key: Value$.
    \item An empty line indicates the end of the header fields.
    \item Optionally, requests can contain a message body. Its encoding is dependent on value of the $Content-Type$ header. If present, the length of the message body is specified in the $Content-Length$ header.
\end{itemize}
The structure of \ac{HTTP} responses is similar to \ac{HTTP} requests \cite{rfc1945}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A status line including the \ac{HTTP} version and status code (e.g. $200$ meaning \enquote{OK}, indicating a successful response). The status line is terminated by a set of \ac{CR} \ac{LF} characters.
    \item A set of response header fields, encoded just like the above-said request headers.
    \item An empty line.
    \item Optional message body. Like request message bodies, the encoding of the message body depends on the value of the $Content-Type$ header.
\end{itemize}
Figure \ref{fig:curl-http-request-respose} shows a \ac{HTTP} requests to the site \enquote{httpbin.org}. By definition, \ac{HTTP} sends data in clear-text. Thus, \ac{HTTP} communication can be intercepted and manipulated by malicious actors. \ac{HTTPS} was introduced to solve this issue by sending \ac{HTTP} requests and responses through \ac{TLS} encrypted connections \cite{rfc2818}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=12cm]{img/ch03/http-request-response.png}
    \captionof{figure}{A truncated \ac{HTTP} request (indicated by \enquote{>}) to \enquote{httpbin.org} using the utility \enquote{curl} and the truncated response received from the remote server (indicated by \enquote{<}).}
    \label{fig:curl-http-request-respose}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{\ac{WS}}
The WebSocket protocol is a bidirectional application protocol used on top of \ac{TCP} connections proposed in RFC6455 \cite{rfc6455}. As stated in the RFC, it was designed to enable web applications to communicate via a bidirectional channel. In order to reuse existing infrastructure, \ac{WS} was designed to upgrade existing \ac{TCP} connections for \ac{HTTP} and replace the text-based \ac{HTTP} communication with a binary frame-based protocol. The \ac{WS} protocol defines header fields for various purposes. One of those fields is the $reserved bits$ field that was intended to be used with extensions to the protocol. One such extension is the \ac{PMCE} that implements compression for frames \cite{rfc7692}.

\subsubsection{Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (\ac{MQTT})}
Proposed as an \ac{OASIS} standard, \ac{MQTT} is described as a protocol that requires a client/server architecture and employs the publish/subscribe pattern for message queueing and routing \cite{gupta_banks_2019}. \ac{MQTT} clients can publish and subscribe to \emph{topics}\footnote{Topics are arbitrary strings. \ac{MQTT} defines special characters that can be used as wildcards.}. \ac{MQTT} servers (called \enquote{brokers}) do not transform messages or process them in any meaningful way but only implement routing and broadcasting functionalities. Thus, contrary to other client/server based protocols, the central unit is not intended to process the transmitted messages. Similarly to \ac{HTTP}, \ac{MQTT} by itself does not implement security features and connection credential are sent in plain text. To improve on this, \ac{TLS} can be used as an underlying transport protocol to encrypt \ac{MQTT} messages.

\subsubsection{Industrial Protocols}
In industrial automation environments, other additional protocols are used. These include protocols that were initially conceived as serial protocols that communicated via bus topologies (e.g. Modbus and Profibus) and were over time upgraded to be operated in \ac{IP}-based networks (e.g. Modbus \ac{TCP} and Profinet) as well as modern protocols that employ security features (such as \ac{OPC U/A}). As these protocols are of little relevance to this thesis, they are not discussed in further detail.

\section{Information Security}
\label{sec:information-security}
The following sections discuss properties, methodologies and tools used in information security.

\subsection{The CIA Triad}
In information security, there are three properties to information systems defined in \ac{ISO}/\ac{IEC} 27000:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Confidentiality: \enquote{Property that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes}. \cite{ISOIEC27000}
    \item Integrity: \enquote{Property of accuracy and completeness}. \cite{ISOIEC27000}
    \item Availability: \enquote{Property of being accessible and usable on demand by an authorized entity}. \cite{ISOIEC27000}
\end{itemize}
These properties are commonly referred to as the \enquote{CIA triad} of \enquote{CIA definitions}. However, there are shortcomings to these definitions that are discussed in literature: for instance, by presenting a set of examples, Lundgren et al. point out that the CIA definitions are not suitable to appropriately cover all security requirements \cite{Lundgren2019DefiningIS}.

\subsection{Methodology}
Information security involves a variety of techniques and methodologies. The ones relevant to this work are discussed in the following sections.
\subsubsection{Penetration Testing}
The SANS Institute defines penetration testing as \enquote{the authorized, scheduled and systematic process of using known vulnerabilities in an attempt to perform an intrusion into host, network or application resources} \cite{braden_2002}.\\
There are various guidelines for penetration tests targetting different types of applications: The \ac{OWASP} \ac{ASVS}, \ac{MSVS} and \ac{ISVS} propose open standards for conducting web application, mobile application and \ac{IoT} penetration tests, respectively \cite{owaspasvs}\cite{owaspmsvs}\cite{owaspisvs}.\\
The \ac{OWASP} \ac{PTES} divides the penetration testing process into seven phases \cite{owaspptes}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Pre-engagement Interactions: Preparation of the penetration test and definition of the scope of the test (e.g. networks and duration).
    \item Intelligence Gathering: Collecting information about the target systems (e.g. making use of \ac{OSINT} methods and tools) to reduce the risk of being detected by security systems.
    \item Threat Modelling: Inferring potential systems in place, risks associated with the operation of those and possible mitigations thereof that may indicate potential attack vectors\footnote{\enquote{The attack vector is the way in which an attack reaches its target.} \cite{HANSMAN200531}}.
    \item Vulnerability Analysis: Identification and verification of vulnerabilities.
    \item Exploitation: Active abuse of found vulnerabilities to achieve goals such as privilege escalation or pivoting\footnote{\enquote{Pivoting is the exclusive method of using an instance also known by \enquote{foothold} to be able to \enquote{move} from place to place inside the compromised network.} \cite{shaikh_2017}}.
    \item Post Exploitation: Establishing persistent access to compromised systems and exfiltration of data (such as evidence of compromise).
    \item Reporting: Producing a report that documents found vulnerabilities and exploits used against the system. This document serves the contractor as a basis for decisions to make about the further development of the system.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Red-Teaming}
Oakley describes (cyber) red-teaming as a technique \enquote{to simulate [an] attack against an organization to test information systems and their related facilities} \cite[p.1-14]{Oakley2019}.

\subsubsection{Fuzzing}
Sutton et al. define fuzzing as \enquote{a method for discovering faults in software by providing unexpected input and monitoring for exceptions} indicating \enquote{undefined or insecure behaviour} \cite[p.22]{Sutton2007}.

\subsubsection{Man-In-The-Middle Attacks}
The \ac{ACSC} defines \ac{MITM} as \enquote{a form of malicious activity where the attacker secretly accesses, relays and possibly alters the communication between two parties who believe they are communicating directly with each other} \cite{pitm2020}.

\subsection{Tools}
There are many tools used in information security. They vary greatly in their features, fields of use and maturity. The following paragraphs describe tools relevant to this thesis and the fields of use it touches.

\paragraph{Wireshark} First released in 1998, \emph{Wireshark} is a cross-platform and open-source tool used for network analysis, including \emph{network sniffing}\footnote{\enquote{Packet sniffing is a method of tapping each packet as it flows across the network.}\cite{packetsniffing}} \cite{wireshark}. It is written mainly in C, consists of more than 3,600,000 lines of C code\footnote{This number was returned by the \emph{cloc} utility run on commit \emph{c73ab16b} from 23rd May 2021 of Wireshark's GitLab source-code repository \cite{wiresharkgit}.} and features a \ac{GUI}. Although it is described as a network protocol analyser, it also supports sniffing of \ac{USB} packets. It implements a wide array of \emph{dissectors} for various protocols and allows detailed examination of network packets (as shown in figure \ref{fig:wireshark}).

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=14cm]{img/ch03/wireshark.png}
    \captionof{figure}{Screenshot of Wireshark being executed and dissecting a \ac{HTTP} $GET$ request to the site \enquote{httpbin.org}. The display-filter \enquote{tcp.port == 80} shows only packets sent to or from port 80 (e.g. \ac{HTTP} communication).}
    \label{fig:wireshark}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Protocol Specific \ac{MITM} Tools}
The following tools are \ac{MITM} that support specific protocols only:

\paragraph{Burp Suite} Developed and distributed by \enquote{PortSwigger} as a commercial product, \emph{Burp Suite} is a tool specialized for web-application testing \cite{burpsuite}. It can be used as a \ac{MITM} for \ac{HTTP} communication by configuring the operating system or browser to use its internal \ac{HTTP} server as a proxy. While it implements basic support for \ac{WS}, it is mainly used for \ac{HTTP} (and nowadays \ac{HTTPS}) and lacks support for other protocols. Aside from its internal proxy server, it also provides specialized features such as the \enquote{Repeater} which is used to send forged \ac{HTTP} requests. The freely available \enquote{Community Edition} (shown in figure \ref{fig:burpsuite}) allows use of most of the tool's features.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=14cm]{img/ch03/burpsuite.png}
    \captionof{figure}{Screenshot of Burp Suite being used to send forged \ac{HTTP} requests to the site \enquote{httpbin.org}.}
    \label{fig:burpsuite}
\end{figure}
\paragraph{mitmproxy} %focused on HTTP/S + WS but supports extension, largely undocumented source
\enquote A multi-purpose \ac{MITM} tool that implements (de-) serialization of \ac{TCP} packets, \ac{TLS}, \ac{HTTP}, and \ac{WS} communication \cite{mitmproxy}. It is written in Python and features a web-interface and a Python \ac{API} for extending mitmproxy.

\paragraph{mProxy} A \ac{MQTT} proxy written in Go that by itself does not feature any interactive interfaces for penetration testers and lacks support for \ac{MQTT} over \ac{TLS} \cite{mproxy}. It is, however, scriptable and enables penetration testers to execute scripts on individual \ac{MQTT} messages.

\paragraph{IOXY} Similarly to mProxy, \enquote{IOXY} is a \ac{MQTT} proxy written in Go. It improves on mProxy's shortcomings and implements a web interface and supports \ac{MQTT} over \ac{TLS} \cite{ioxy}.
%Generic
\subsubsection{Generic \acp{MITM} Tools}
The following tools are generic \ac{MITM} tools that support a wide range of network protocols:
\paragraph{ettercap} While \emph{ettercap} was initially developed as a network sniffer for switched \ac{LAN}, it was gradually extended to implement a set of \ac{MITM} attacks such as \ac{ARP} spoofing and \emph{packet filtering} which allowed modifying intercepted communication \cite{ettercap}. Penetration testers can write custom filters in a scripting language to implement their own packet filtering logic. It is written in C and implements network protocols of layers 1 to 4 of the \ac{OSI} model. Thus, it does not implement application protocols.
\paragraph{bettercap} Similar to ettercap, \emph{bettercap} implements network sniffing and other features used for network analysis and discovery. However, contrary to ettercap, it aims to support a wider range of transport technologies and is described by its authors as \enquote{\emph{the Swiss Army knife for WiFi, Bluetooth Low Energy, wireless HID hijacking and IPv4 and IPv6 network reconnaissance and MITM attacks}} \cite{bettercap}. It is written in Go and features a web-interface for configuration, control and monitoring.
\paragraph{Scapy} Its authors describe \enquote{scapy} as a \enquote{a powerful interactive packet manipulation program} \cite{scapy}. It is written in Python and can be used to craft and parse packets of various protocols.
\paragraph{MITMf} Built on top of scapy, \enquote{MITMf} implements a set of attacks against network devices \cite{mitmf}. However, it is no longer updated and its authors suggest using bettercap instead.
