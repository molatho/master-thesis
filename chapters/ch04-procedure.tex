\chapter{Procedure}
The following chapters document the work on the design concepts and implementations of the modular proxy application in chronological order. However, the common thread running through these chapters can be hard to miss which is why this chapter briefly elaborates on the procedure of and steps taken in this work.\\
To get an understanding of the problem space, a first prototype was built. The challenges that were encountered during implementation resulted in a set of questions towards experts. These very specific questions and a set of generic questions regarding the context of assessing the security of \ac{IoT} applications were what became an interview guideline. This guideline was used to conduct interviews with a set of experts and answer the aforementioned questions.\\
These answers and the insights gained from designing and implementing the first prototype were then considered during two consecutive iterations of developing a new design concept. The resulting design concept was then used to implement another prototype.
