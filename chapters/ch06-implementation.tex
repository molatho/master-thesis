\chapter{Implementing the Modular Proxy Application}
\label{chap:implementation}
This chapter covers an exemplaric implementation of the concept that was worked out in chapter \ref{chap:conceptual-design}, starting with formally describing the goals and constraints of this implementation in section \ref{sec:goals-constraints}. Afterwards, an overview and comparison of available and suitable tools for the task is performed in section \ref{sec:tool-selection}. The chapter concludes with details about the implementation of individual components in section \ref{sec:individual-components}, describing how specific challenges were overcome and what design patterns were used.
