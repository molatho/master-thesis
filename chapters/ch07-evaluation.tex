\label{chap:evaluation}

This chapter covers an attempt to measure the fitness for use of both the design concept developed in chapter \ref{chap:conceptual-design} and the prototype implemented in chapter \ref{chap:implementation}. First, two case studies and the methodology of how they were performed is described in \ref{sec:case-studies}, detailing their individual setups, the tests that were conducted and the results they yielded. Then, feedback given by experts is discussed in \ref{sec:expert-feedback}, providing insights to their perception of the prototype.
