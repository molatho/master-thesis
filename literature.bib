However, in the past several years numerous targeted attacks on industrial control systems have been discovered. This paper highlights the diverse threat landscape and then describes a stratified security architecture for a specific industrial scenario from an ongoing research project. The resulting system uses a Broker-based data exchange infrastructure and hardware-based security to provide transparent and end-to-end protected data exchange.},
